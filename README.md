# Javascript-Drum-Kit

This is an excersize to continue to grow and develop my javascript coding skills. The idea is to create a simple webpage that acts as a basic drumkit using only html, JS and CSS.

Taken from lesson one in the Javascript30 course. 

This is a simple site, that uses basic keycode info to assign a set of sounds to the center row keys, and add visual prompts on the screen to tell the user which key is related to which sound. 

When pressed, the corresponding sound will play, and a basic css transition will animate to show what was pressed.
